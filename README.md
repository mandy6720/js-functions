## JavaScript - Functions - Week 2, assignment 2

### What I did

In this assignment, I worked more with TDD (test driven development). Similar to the assignment from the previous day, I was given a series of empty functions that were not passing. In order to complete the assignment, I needed to write code that would make them pass their respecrive tests.

In addition to learning about JS functions, we also went into detail about writing DRY (don't repeat yourself) code.

The original instructions are below.







## JavaScript - Functions

### Description

Today we talked about functions in JavaScript -- code blocks that can be executed on-demand, which accept parameters and perform tasks on or with them.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should...

* Understand JavaScript functions - definition, invocation, parameters, and returns
* Understand the principle of DRY
* Be comfortable with a standard TDD workflow
* Have practiced some algorithmic thinking

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to effectively use:

* JavaScript functions
* Test-Driven development
* node.js and Express to run a simple web server

## Details

This assignment consists of a simple test runner that's performing tests on functions that we need to complete.

## Normal Mode

Complete the six functions in `public/max.js`, `public/power.js`, and `public/average.js` so that all tests (which are defined in the `public/test` folder) pass.

The first function in each file should be somewhat straightforward. The second function in each file **must** utilize the first function.

**Note**: Please create a git commit after every function's tests are passing for the first time.

## Hard Mode

In additional to normal mode...

1. Complete the four functions in `public/vowel.js` and `public/reverse.js` so that all tests pass. Same as before, the first function in each file should be utilized by the second function.

2. Write up another two-tiered set of functions, and write a similar suite of tests for them.
